# Hangman_game

A simple hangman game written in C++. It can be played by two or more players. 
One player is the "host" that picks the secret word, which other players guess
letter by letter. Each missed letter is visually presented, with a maximum of
6 missed letters, after which the game is over. Two correct letter guesses turn on
the option to guess the whole word. If the players correctly guess the secret word,
game is over and they win. I used vectors to store wrong letter guesses by players, which are
diplayed after every guess.

**Have fun playing the game!**
